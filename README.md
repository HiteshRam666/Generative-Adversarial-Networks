# 🧠 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 🎨

Welcome to the **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** project! This repository showcases the implementation of GANs from scratch, exploring how two neural networks (generator and discriminator) compete with each other to produce realistic data from noise. 🚀

## 💡 Project Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revolutionized the world of artificial intelligence by enabling machines to generate realistic images, videos, and even music. In this notebook, you'll learn how to implement a basic GAN architecture and train it on a dataset to generate **stunning images**. 🌈

### 🔥 Key Features

- 🧑‍💻 **Fully Implemented GAN**: From the architecture of the generator and discriminator to the loss functions.
- 🎨 **Image Generation**: Train the GAN on a dataset to produce realistic images.
- 📊 **Training Visualization**: Monitor the loss and generated images at each step of training.
